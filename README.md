# 🐾 Black Cats Appreciation Society (BCAS)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Black Cats Appreciation Society** — a web project built to debunk myths, celebrate black feline beauty, and promote black cat adoption. 🖤🐈‍⬛

This site was originally developed as a final course project for **CIS373: Web Design and Development** at Strayer University, and continues to evolve with love, JavaScript, and the occasional 
paw swipe from Dresden and Pandora - my 2024 Christmas Present Adoptions.
